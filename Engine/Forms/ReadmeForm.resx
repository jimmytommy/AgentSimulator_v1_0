    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

EXECUTABLE
----------
The executable "AgentSimulator.exe" is located in the "data" directory of the same project.  It runs the multiagent room-clearing experiment described below with the parameters in the params.txt file.  Descriptions of how to change the experiment in the GUI and commandline mode are included below.

The project files that are included should also allow for easy compilation either in Microsoft's Visual Studio or in monodevelop on Linux.

--------------
3. EXPERIMENTS
--------------

When run, the experiments will output the generation number, the fitness, and the amount of time per generation, for each generation.  The experiment will also write out an XML file containing the highest fitness genome whenever a new maximum fitness is reached.

ROOM CLEARING EXPERIMENT
-------------------------
The room-clearing experiment with multiagent hyperneat (“roomclear_exp_hetero.xml) is presented in the 2010 AAMAS paper (see above) . The goal of the experiment is for a group of agents to view as much of a room as possible. For comparison purposes, the same experiment with homogenous teams (“roomclear_exp_homo.xml”) is also included.
----------------------------
EVOLVABLE-SUBSTRATE MAZE NAVIGATION EXPERIMENT

The maze navigation experiment (“hardmaze_exp.xml”) is presented in the 2011 GECCO paper on ES-HyperNEAT (see above). The goal of the agent is to navigate from a starting to an end location. The main ES-HyperNEAT code can be found in the SharpNeatLib\CPPNs\EvolvableSubstrate.cs class. The main method in that class is “generateConnections”, which generates a list of ANN connections and hidden nodes based on the information in the underlying CPPN. This function is called from the SubstrateDescription.cs class. The parameters for ES-HyperNEAT can be changed in the params.txt file (see below). For questions on ES-HyperNEAT email sebastian.risi@gmail.com
--------------------------
PATROL AND RETURN
The patrol and return experiment with situational policy geometry (“patrol_switch.xml”) is presented in the 2011 IROS paper above.  The goal is for the team of agents to spread out among an environment, and then return to their starting place. For comparison purposes, the same experiment, but without situational policy geometry (“patrol_signal.xml”) is also included.

PARAMETER FILE
--------------------------

The main parameters of HyperNEAT can be changed in the included params.txt using this guide:

Threshold .2
WeightRange 3
NumberofThreads 1
SubstrateActivationFunction SteepenedSigmoid
StartActivationFunctions
BipolarSigmoid .25
Sine .25
Gaussian .25
Linear .25
EndActivationFunctions

//Evolvable-Substrate HyperNEAT parameters
InitialRes 8
DivisionThrs 10 
VarianceThr .03
BandingThr .3
ESIterations 1


Threshold defines the minimum value a CPPN must output for that 
connection to be expressed, should be 0-1.

WeightRange defines the minimum and maximum values for weights on substrate
connections, they go from -WeightRange to +WeightRange, and can be any integer.

NumberofThreads defines the number of simultaneous evaluations to run.  
This can be any integer greater than 0, however numbers greater than
the number of cores/processors you have available can degrade performance.
Note: Evolution with multiple threads is an experimental feature.

SubstrateActivationFunction determines which activation function each node
in the substrate will have.  This can be any of the activation functions in 
SharpNEATLib, you can add your own as well.  The activation function is the name of the 
.cs file containing that function (they are accessed by reflection, so case counts).

Activation Functions that can be in the CPPN start with 
"StartActivationFunctions" and are listed one per line and ended with 
"EndActivationFunctions".  Each activation function is the name of the .cs file
containing that function (they are accessed by reflection, so case counts) followed
by the probability of that function appearing.

The following parameters can be set to adjust ES-HyperNEAT:

InitialRes defines the initial ES-HyperNEAT sample resolution.

DivisionThrs defines the division threshold. If the variance in a region is greater than this value, after the initial resolution is reached, ES-HyperNEAT will sample down further (values greater than 1.0 will disable this feature). Note that sampling at really high resolutions can become computationally expensive. 

VarianceThr defines the variance threshold for the initial sampling.

BandingThr defines the threshold that determines when points are regarded to be in a band.

ESIterations defines how many time ES-HyperNEAT should iterativelty discover new hidden nodes.


COMMAND LINE
--------------
If called with the parameter "evolve" the command line tool is used. Otherwise the visual simulator is started.

The available command line parameters:

-experiment [filename]         	//Evolve using this experiment.
-homogenous [true/false]	//If true use homogenous teams otherwise heterogenous
-populationSize [number]
-generations [number]
-agent_count [number]
-novelty                     		//Use novelty search
-fitness_function [filename]
-hidden_density [number]     	//Specifies the number of hidden neurons
-input_density [number]      	//Specifies the number of input neurons
-rng_seed [number]           	//What random seed should be used.
-environment [filename]
-substrate [filename]
-eval [filename]               	 //Evaluate the given genome and return fitness
-seed [filename]             	 //Seed evolution with the given genome
-folder [name]               	 //Output files to the specified folder
-multiobjective 		 //Turns on multiobjective search
-es [true/false]		 //Turn on/off evolvable-substrate HyperNEAT
-help 			//Shows the command line options


The command line tool will output genome files whenever a new champion is discovered. These genome files can be viewed in the visualizer. 

THE USER INTERFACE
---------------
The MultiAgent-HyperSharpNEAT Simulator GUI has 5 menus: File, Mode, Simulation, Evolution, and Help.

The File menu allows you to load and save experiments, genomes and environments. Included in this package is a representative sample individual evolved with ES Hyperneat. To run it, you must first load the appropriate experiment file (File-&gt;Load-&gt;Experiment), then load the genome file (File-&gt;Load-&gt;Genome). After both the experiment and genome are loaded, you can run the simulation through the Simulation&gt;Run menu item.

It is important to note that the experiment file contains settings that determine how the genome file is interpreted. Running a genome in the context of an experiment file in which it was not evolved will often cause meaningless behavior. The following experiment files can be found the the “data” folder:

roomclear_exp_hetero.xml - MultiAgent HyperNEAT experiment file where robots cannot see each other

roomclear_exp_homo.xml - Homogeneous HyperNEAT experiment file where robots cannot see each other

hardmaze_exp.xml - Navigation Domain from the ES-HyperNEAT GECCO 2011 paper

patrol_switch.xml - Patrol and Return domain from the IROS 2011 paper where the team exploits situational policy geometry.

patrol_signal.xml - Patrol and Return domain from the IROS 2011 paper where the team does not exploit situational policy geometry.

The Mode menu allows you to change the current mode. The mode determines how mouse interaction will affect the environment.
Select mode: Agents and walls can be selected and moved to different locations by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button. This can be used as an experiment is running for interactive exploration of the evolved behaviors of the agents. Agents and walls can also be rotated by clicking and dragging with the right mouse button. 
Wall mode: By clicking and dragging with the left mouse button you can create a new wall.
Start Point, Goal Point, Point of Interest (POI), and Area of Interest (AOI) mode: A click on the environment places the corresponding object. The start point indicates where agents will begin in the environment, the goal point and POI (if used by the fitness function) indicate where agents should reach, and the AOI indicates for the room clearing experiment, what area of the environment should be covered by the agents.

The Simulation menu allows the user to run or reset the simulation (which will cause the agents to return to their initial starting locations). It also allows to explore the effects of scaling the team size (Simulation-&gt;Settings). Scaling to more agents with a homogeneous team (standard HyperNEAT) will add new agents with exactly the same policy, while scaling to more agents with multiagent HyperNEAT will add agents with different policies derived from their initial team geometry. You can also choose different fitness functions (which will influence what behaviors are rewarded when doing fitness-based evolution) , behavioral characterizations (which define the space of behaviors that novelty search will explore), robot models, change the number of rangefinders or turn evolvable-substrate/novelty search on and off. If fitness-based search is used (the novelty search item is not ticked), search will be guided by the chosen fitness function. If novelty search is used, search will depend on the chosen behavioral characterization.

The Evolution menu allows you to start evolution and to display the currently best performing genome. 

The Help menu offers an overview of the available key commands.
